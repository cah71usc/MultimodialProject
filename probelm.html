  <h1>The Problem</h1>
  <p>
    Nearly 85% of all wildfires in the United States are caused by human activities. These include unattended campfires, burning debris, equipment use and malfunctions, discarded cigarettes, and intentional acts of arson.
  </p>
  <p>
    Human-caused wildfires can occur at any time of the year, which is different from wildfires started by lightning that are more prevalent during the summer. These preventable fires threaten lives, destroy property, and consume valuable resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    In recent years, wildfire seasons have grown longer and fires have become more severe due to climate change and increasing human presence in wildland areas.
