  <h1>Impact on the Ecosystem</h1>
  <p>
    Forest fires drastically alter ecosystems. While some ecosystems have adapted to fire, human-caused fires often happen too frequently or with too much intensity, disrupting natural cycles.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wildlife loses its habitat, soil becomes less fertile, and water sources can be contaminated with ash and debris. The biodiversity in these areas can suffer tremendously.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recovery can take years or even decades, and some ecosystems never fully return to their original state.
